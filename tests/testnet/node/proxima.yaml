# Peering configuration
peering:
  # libp2p host data: 
  host:
    # host ID private key (hex-encoded)
    # Placeholder private key. SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH REAL HOST PRIVATE KEY
    id_private_key: <host id private key goes here>
    # host ID is derived from the host ID public key. 
    # Placeholder ID. SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH REAL HOST ID WHICH MATCHES PRIVATE KEY

    port: 4001

  # Statically pre-configured peers, also known as manual peering.
  # Used also for dynamic peer discovery (bootstrap)
  # Each static peer is specified as a pair <name>: <multiaddr>, where:
  # - <name> is unique mnemonic name used for convenience locally
  # - <multiaddr> is the libp2p multi-address in the form '/ip4/<IPaddr ir URL>/<port>/tcp/p2p/<hostID>'
  # for more info see https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/addressing/
  peers:
    # example bootstrap node
