# This is Proxima ledger identity file.
# It contains public Proxima ledger constants set at genesis. 
# The ledger identity file is used to create genesis ledger state for Proxima nodes.
# Private key of the controller should be known only to the creator of the genesis ledger state.
# Public key of the controller identifies originator of the ledger for its lifetime.
# 'genesis_controller_address' is computed from the public key of the controller
# 'bootstrap_chain_id' is a constant, i.e. same for all ledgers
